# Deploying Steadfast

Two free accounts get this live: **Supabase** (database) and **Render** (hosting). The code lives
on GitHub.

## 1. Get your Supabase connection string

You already have a Supabase project. You don't need to run any SQL by hand — Django creates the
tables itself.

1. Open your project on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and click **Connect** at the
   top of the page.
2. Under **Connection String**, pick the **Session pooler** option and copy the URI. It looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.abcdefghijkl:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```
   Use the session pooler rather than the "Direct connection": the direct one is IPv6-only, and
   Render (like many hosts) can only reach it over IPv4.
3. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the database password you chose when creating the project
   (forgot it? **Project Settings → Database → Reset database password**). If the password has
   characters like `@`, `#`, `/` or `:`, URL-encode them (e.g. `@` → `%40`), or reset it to
   letters and numbers only.

That full string is your `DATABASE_URL`.

## 2. Create the tables (optional, from your computer)

Render runs migrations on every deploy, so you can skip this. To check your connection first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # paste DATABASE_URL in, and set SECRET_KEY
python manage.py migrate
```

Afterwards, Supabase's **Table Editor** shows `tracker_user`, `tracker_checkin`,
`tracker_urgelog` and Django's own tables, each marked as having RLS enabled.

## 3. Deploy on Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up / log in with GitHub.
2. Click **New → Blueprint**, pick this repository, and confirm. Render reads `render.yaml`, which
   sets up the build (`build.sh`: install, collect static files, migrate) and a generated
   `SECRET_KEY`.
3. When asked for `DATABASE_URL`, paste the connection string from step 1.
4. Click **Apply**. After a few minutes you'll get a URL like `https://steadfast-xxxx.onrender.com`.
   Open it and create your account.

Render's free tier sleeps after 15 minutes without visitors, so the first page load after a quiet
spell takes 30–60 seconds. The paid Starter plan stays awake.

## Optional extras

- **Password reset emails**: add `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`,
  `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` and `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` in Render → your service → **Environment**. Any
  SMTP provider works (Gmail with an app password, Resend, Brevo, …). Without them, reset links
  only appear in Render's logs.
- **Admin**: in Render → your service → **Shell**, run `python manage.py createsuperuser`, then
  visit `/admin/`.
- **Custom domain**: Render → your service → **Settings → Custom Domains**. Then add the domain to
  `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and its `https://` origin to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`.
- **Updating the app**: push to `main`; Render redeploys and runs any new migrations.
